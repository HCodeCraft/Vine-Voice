Welcome to Vine Voice!

A site to help you keep track of your plants, learn more about them, and share your knowledge and enthusiasm for plants with others!

I built this app with a Ruby on Rails/Postgresql backend and a React/Redux Toolkit Frontend, with Material UI for styling. You can create an account and search through the database for your plant or through perenual.com’s extensive plant API, then create an entry about your specific plant, complete with Nickname, Notes, Health Status, and Problems, as well as whether you want advice about your plant. Everyone can comment on each other's entries, spreading information and goodwill. Admin users have additional privileges, like adding plants not included in perenual.com’s API, editing and deleting plants, and managing users (complete with a user management page). Try Vine Voice out today! You can also view a video of the app’s functionality below. Thank you for viewing!
